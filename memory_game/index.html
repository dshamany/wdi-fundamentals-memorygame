    <h2>Why This Memory Game?</h2>
    <p>Playing any memory game may enhance your ability to recall topics from your working memory.
        Humans can only store 6 or 7 items for a quick recall, but if distracted may only hold fewer 
        pieces of information. This game will surely assist you in improving your memory.

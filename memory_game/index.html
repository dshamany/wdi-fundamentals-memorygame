    <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, 
        is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped 
        face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why">Why This Memory Game?</h2>
    <p>Playing any memory game may enhance your ability to recall topics from your working memory.
        Humans can only store 6 or 7 items for a quick recall, but if distracted may only hold fewer 
        pieces of information. This game will surely assist you in improving your memory.
